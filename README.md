Making a survival craft game about building a factory.

You build robots that do stuff for you, like mining ores, and trying to optimize them so they do more stuff for you.

You can follow development on livecoding.tv : https://www.livecoding.tv/blue112/

# Done:

- Make some mining engine (1 tile x 1 tile)
- Make the ME put item in front of it, it there's no other item in front of it, otherwise, stop working
- Change the direction of which it places the item (rotate ME)
- Belt conveyors
- Add map layers
- Add drop shadow to floor items
- Rotate a building while placing it
- Map save
- Chests
- Automatic inventory view refresh when model changes
- Save chest inventory
- Get item in chest
- Oven (Iron + Coal => Iron Bars)
- Add a GUI window to the oven
- Be able to move windows with drag'n'drop
- [BUG] Opening the craft window when the inventory is opened prevents from closing both
- Deconstruct buildings
- Add back the floating message when the player's inventory changes

# Todo
